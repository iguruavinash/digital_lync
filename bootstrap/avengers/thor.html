            Thor Odinson is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The
            character, which is based on the Norse deity of the same name, is the Asgardian god of thunder who possesses
            the enchanted hammer, Mjolnir, which grants him the ability to fly and manipulate weather amongst his other
            superhuman attributes.

            Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character first appeared in Journey into Mystery #83 (August
            1962) and was created by penciller-plotter Jack Kirby, editor-plotter Stan Lee, and scripter Larry Lieber.
            He has starred in several ongoing series and limited series, and is a founding member of the superhero team
            the Avengers, appearing in each volume of that series. The character has also appeared in associated Marvel
            merchandise including animated television series, movies, video games, clothing, toys and trading cards.

            Thor placed 14th on IGN's list of "Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time" in 2011,[2] and first in their
            list of "The Top 50 Avengers" in 2012. </p>
