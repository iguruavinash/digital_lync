            Captain Marvel is the name of several fictional superheroes appearing in American comic books published by
            Marvel Comics. Most of these versions exist in Marvel's main shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe.
            The first Captain Marvel comic book printed by Marvel Comics was created by Roy Thomas and Gene Colan.[4]
            This character is an alien military officer, Captain Mar-Vell of the Kree Imperial Militia, who is sent to
            observe the planet Earth as it is developing technology to travel into space. Mar-Vell eventually wearies of
            his superiors' malicious intent and allies himself with Earth, and the Kree Empire brands him a traitor.
            From then on, Mar-Vell fights to protect Earth from all threats.</p>
